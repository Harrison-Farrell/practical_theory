# CPU Cache

## Summary
The CPU Cache is the fastest, smallest and closest chunck of memory for the CPU to access. It is often designed in an hierachical fashion.

- L1, The fastest, directly inside each core
- L2, Larger than L1, slightly slower, often dedicated to each core.
- L3, Largest but slowest, shared across multiple cores to manage data coherence.

## Hardware
The benchmarking and graphs have been conducted on a Intel Core i9-13900HX, 32GB DDR5 RAM. Windows 11 Operating System.
